# Competitive Programming in Python

This repo is my personal log of solving problems on platforms like LeetCode and others.  
I’m using Python and focusing on building consistency, problem-solving speed, and understanding core patterns.
This is a curated set of problems I solved. My full log is "Leetcode-solutions" .

## Structure

- Each `.py` file = one problem
- Includes:
  - Link to the original problem
  - My solution
  - Time/space complexity (when I remember)

I don’t write full explanations for everything — only for some problems that felt worth the breakdown.

## Why This Exists

- Track my progress
- Revisit problems later
- Get better at thinking under pressure

## Notes

This isn’t a tutorial repo. It’s just my work in progress.

You’ll find wins, mistakes, and improvements over time.
